GENERAL DESCRIPTION:
My program is called Goblin Slayer, the purpose of this program is to shoot the goblins coming out of the screen, and basically to survive as long as possible, before either the goblins reach your base, you run out of bullets, or you get stabbed. The soldier is ill-fated to never escape the cycle, and he will eventually die, whether it be to the knives that increase in number every 35 seconds, or the goblins that come out faster every 35 seconds! As you can probably infer, every 35 seconds, the difficulty level increases by one and is displayed on screen. It takes 2 shots to kill a goblin, and it progressively gets harder as time goes on. When you first boot up, you will be asked to choose a time interval to see how often you want the goblins to spawn, the average amount being 3 seconds. Then, at every level, the goblins spawn 20 percent faster from there. Depending on the time interval you choose at first, you will get a different number of bullets. If you choose anything less than 2 seconds intervals, you will get 35 bullets. The higher the interval, the less bullets you start off with. You will get an error if you choose a second decimal or number that is not between 1 and 6. There is also a green powerup that gives max health back, and an orange one that gives you more bullets(at each difficulty change, the powerup gives more bullets than before). There are also knives that are thrown by the goblins behind the screen and if you get hit by the knife 2 times, the game ends.

FEATURES:
There are idle, running and shooting animations for the soldier, and individual running animations and death animations for the goblins. There are also sound effects and music that gets played throughout the program.

PURPOSE:
This program is for entertainment purposes, like a game you could play if you're bored at home, as this is a 1 player game. The aim of the game is to see how many kills you can get and what difficulty level you will reach before you die. 

CONTROLS:
You use the W and S key to move the soldier up and down the screen. And you right click the mouse button to fire bullets. When you see a knife coming toward you, try dodging it as it reduces half your health. Try to get the green orb powerup for health, and the orange sword powerup for more bullets, as you run out of bullets pretty quick and you might die if you run out of bullets. Donâ€™t let the goblins reach the base, or the game ends.Try to get a high score of the most kills possible while being aware of the difficulty change that happens the longer you survive.

HOW TO GAME OVER:
If you get one of the three message boxes, this means that the game is over and you have lost, you have to click the ok button to exit.
